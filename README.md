- open ScreenShot Image to see the code and the result of frequent patterns extracted using various classifiers...

Steps taken on the project:
- Preprocessing : Collecting data from web pages and converting them into structured form
- Detailed examination of the dataset and selection of the desired features
- stemming and lemmatization and removing stop words
- Keyword Extraction : Keyword extraction using BER trained data model
- Frequent Pattern Extraction: Relationships between keywords also using associative rule extraction
