# DataMining-Project-TUM-Courses-Extraction
a project to extract and clustering the extracted Courses at a university

• Goal is to classify courses on TUM university, Scraping data and Preprocessing From TUM University
Website (using bs4)

• Keyword and Frequent Pattern Extraction using BERT pre-trained data model

• Classiffication using KNN, MLP and SVM

- open ScreenShot Image (or click on link below) to see the code and the result of frequent patterns extracted using various classifiers...

Steps taken on the project:
- Preprocessing : Collecting data from web pages and converting them into structured form
- Detailed examination of the dataset and selection of the desired features
- stemming and lemmatization and removing stop words
- Keyword Extraction : Keyword extraction using BERT trained data model
- Frequent Pattern Extraction: Relationships between keywords also using associative rule extraction
- Classification using KNN, Perceptron, MLP and SVM
