The individual milestones are defined as follows: 1.	At first, students develop an online-based business model in a team and explain the reason for choosing this model. Afterwards, they plan the project, assign tasks to team members and justify planning decisions. Finally, the developed business model is presented to the audience. (22%) 2.	After the business model is developed, it is expected from the teams to select appropriate patterns to design the web application and to apply them in form of a first mockup. Students have to pay attention to apply an user-centered, iterative development process. (12%)3.	Based upon the mockups the first prototype of the web application is developed by the students. During the development process, state-of-the-art technologies for web application implementation have to be identified and applied. This encompasses both client- and server-side aspects.

These ideas have to differ from existing concepts. This step includes an analysis of the current market situation, to allow the students to assess the practicability and the profitability of the idea. Therefore, a project plan has to be developed.

It will be of advantage if you have already an idea (e.g. through the Image Guided Surgery module) and you want to validate throughout the module if this is an innovation (i.e. it has potential in a market) or if it is only a great idea/invention.","You know the basics of imaging and image guidance and you are interested in understanding the difference between research and clinical solutions.

This requires active attendance of the interactive lectures. For optimal guidance, several stages of this process are evaluated in either written (value proposition canvas and documentation of validated innovation) or oral form (2 presentations), allowing the lecturer to provide in-depth feedback.Grading will be based on attendance (10%), the mid-term presentation (10%), the final group presentation (20%), written assignments/report (40%), and a written test (45 minutes) on the technology basics (20%). Written assignments and oral presentations are conducted in groups of 2-4 students.",,https://www.tum.de/en/,,
University of Munich,TUM,Informatic,Technology and Law,5,"Pretschner, Alexander; Prof. Dr.: alexander.pretschner@tum.de","After successful completion of this module students will be able to:•	outline the most important phases in the development of technology law, and describe the relationship between technology and law.•	understand the most important fundamentals of civil and criminal liability and their application to autonomous systems.•	identify duty of care standards and thus be able to adequately analyse questions of negligence.•	outline potential civil and criminal liability questions, based on technical issues, arising in previously unseen hypothetical cases.•	explain the most important structures and principles of data protection law and understand European influences on this area of law.•	set out and explain the legality of driver assistance systems and the challenges, for example in the area of civil liability, arising from the use of autonomous vehicles. •	be able to differentiate the responsibilities of providers under the Telemedia Act and discuss specific problematic issues.•	apply what they have learned to previously unseen cases and independently develop solutions in which they link legal aspects with technical ones. Thus they will be able to draw the line between ""legally permissible"" and ""technically possible"".",None,None,,not specified,,"In this course, students should not think that they can do well simply by memorizing. Rather, students are encouraged to learn and challenged by the coursework.Thus, at the end of each chapter, there are learning control questions consisting of multiple-choice and fill in the blank questions. By voluntarily and independently answering the questions, the students can check their understanding of the topics covered.The course concludes with a written examination.This consists primarily of solving a hypothetical case based on a brief set of facts. This allows students to display their understanding of the issues arising in the case, and then argue their positions. The case solving section is 50% of the final exam.In addition, the final examination includes multiple-choice questions, which contribute 20% to the overall exam grade, and open questions (30%).When writing their answers, students should demonstrate both that they have understood the fundamental issues arising in the area of technology and law and that they can apply their acquired knowledge to concrete problems. Areas covered are the historical development of technology law, the basics of civil liability and criminal liability, data protection and data security, driver assistance systems and provider liability.The duration of the final written examination is 60 minutes.",,https://www.tum.de/en/,,

Rather, the learning activity of the students should be in constant demand. For this reason there are learning control questions at the end of each chapter, which consist of multiple choice and sentence completion questions. By solving the questions voluntarily and independently, the students can check their understanding of the topic they have worked through. At the end of the course a written examination is administered. This examination consists mainly of a short factual case solution, which enables students to demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter and to try out argumentation structures. The case solution is 50% of the final degree.In addition, the exam consists of multiple-choice questions, which account for 20 % of the total exam result, and free questions (30 %).The students are expected to demonstrate that they have understood the basic structures and problem constellations of data protection law and that they can apply the acquired knowledge to concrete examples. Students should have knowledge of the historical development and principles of data protection law, the application of the relevant norms of the DSGVO and the BDSG, the permissibility of data processing, the rights and obligations of those involved in data processing and sanctions under data protection law.
